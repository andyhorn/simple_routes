## 1.0.0

We have finally reached a stable release! ðŸŽ‰

### New Features
  * Manage "extra" data with the `ExtraDataMixin` on your SimpleRouteDataFactory
    * Inject "extra" data into the GoRouterState with the new `extra` property
    * Safely extract typed "extra" data from the GoRouterState using `containsExtra` and `extractExtra`
  * Automatic leading-slash management - no more worrying about whether or not to add a leading slash to your route's `path`
  * Get the full path of a `DataRoute`, with all template parameters populated, using the new `generate` method

### Breaking Changes

This release includes a few breaking changes.

  * The `query` parameter of the `go` method has been removed in favor of utilizing a `RouteData` class to inject and extract your query parameters
  * The `push` argument of the `go` method has been removed in favor of using a discrete `push` method on your route class
  * A new `goPath` property has been added to the `SimpleRoute` class and should be used when defining your `GoRoute`s. For example: `GoRoute(path: const MyRoute().goPath, ...)`
  * The helper methods have all been removed in favor of extensions and class methods
    * `withPrefix` has been replaced with `Enum.prefixed` - `MyEnum.myValue.prefixed`
    * `join` has been replaced with `Iterable<String>#toPath` - `['path', 'to', 'join'].toPath()`

**Breaking Change**

- Change `go` method to use named parameters for `data` and `query`

Instead of writing:

```dart
const MyRoute().go(
  context, 
  const MyRouteData('some-value'), 
  {'key': 'value'},
);
```

You will now need to write it as:

```dart
const MyRoute().go(
  context, 
  data: const MyRouteData('some-value'), 
  query: {'key': 'value'},
);
```
