## 1.0.0-beta.1

We have finally reached a stable release! ðŸŽ‰

Granted, this is just a beta release for the moment, we are confident that it is stable enough to be classified as version 1.

This release includes a significant rework of the API to improve the developer experience and standardize our package conventions.

Please see the [Migration Guide](doc/migration_guide.md) for information on how to migrate your code to this version from the pre-release versions.

### New Features
  * Path parameters are now injected automatically, based on the `parameters` property
  * Query parameters are now appended automatically, based on the `query` property
  * Extra data is now injected automatically, based on the `extra` property
  * Automatic leading-slash management - no more worrying about whether or not to add a leading slash to your route's `path`
  * Get the full path of a `DataRoute`, with all template parameters populated, using the new `generate` method

### Breaking Changes

This release includes a few breaking changes.

  * The `query` parameter of the `go` method has been removed
  * The `push` argument of the `go` method has been removed
  * A new `goPath` property has been added to the `SimpleRoute` class and should be used when defining your `GoRoute`s
  * The `inject` method has been removed from the `DataRoute` class
  * The helper methods have all been removed in favor of extensions and class methods

## 0.0.11

## 0.0.10

- Attempt to fix release workflow (again)

## 0.0.9

- Add support for pushing routes

## 0.0.8

- Version bump for release workflow fixes

## 0.0.7

**Breaking Change**

- Change `go` method to use named parameters for `data` and `query`

Instead of writing:

```dart
const MyRoute().go(
  context, 
  const MyRouteData('some-value'), 
  {'key': 'value'},
);
```

You will now need to write it as:

```dart
const MyRoute().go(
  context, 
  data: const MyRouteData('some-value'), 
  query: {'key': 'value'},
);
```

## 0.0.3

- Add helper method for extracting query param map from GoRouterState
- Fix bug in route data factory
- Add and improve tests

## 0.0.2
